Even the most casual of glances at the Twitter feed of the president of the United States of America these days induces a kind of vertigo: how could this be happening? How can the person in this position, with this kind of power, be saying and doing what this man is saying and doing? Why isn’t anyone stopping this? It’s upsetting and confusing, of course; and it can lead to a feeling of groundlessness and exasperation. (It’s also why, if you’re going to use Twitter at all, I would recommend muting that particular account. It makes Twitter much more usable)

After the initial shock, you might wonder how we got to this point. How did things get so out of whack that a Twitter troll, a petulant billionaire without a shred of compassion, wisdom or political understanding, has risen to the most powerful position in the world? Kurt Andersen’s [Fantasyland](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/209776/fantasyland-by-kurt-andersen/9780812978902/) presents a compelling explanation for this madness: it’s the culmination of various tendencies in American culture and psyche, in particular the American tendency to be taken in by fantasy of all kinds. (Andersen was apparently already working on this book when the Trump presidency became a real possibility, but our 45th president happens to be the perfect exhibit A — “to describe him is practically to summarize this book.”)

“Fantasyland” recasts our history as the unfolding of a tremendous “will to belief”, a distinctly American tendency to fashion reality from fabricated ideas, to see the imagination as the ultimate source of truth. True to his tagline (“A 500-Year History”) Andersen goes all the way back to the marketing of America to European settlers as a place where gold was bountiful and flowing like water, though his real first target is the religious settlers, in particular the Puritans, and their various ways of understanding reality as controlled by unseen forces. 

What I found most interesting about the earlier parts of the book was Andersen’s compelling explication of the fracturing of American Protestantism and its connection to the tendency to “go our own way,” believing in whatever we’d like without any external leadership or guidance — a tendency we can trace to today’s outrageous conspiracy theories. The plurality of the book is dedicated to exploring this strain of thought, and it is Andersen’s most fertile ground. He argues that this tendency is somewhat inherent in Protestantism itself, with its emphasis on faith through a _personal_ knowledge of God. In America, as an empty slate playground for Protestant exploration, this tendency was given unfettered reign over human behavior, and resulted in a flourishing of idiosyncratic visions of spiritual life. I came away from these parts of the book with a new understanding of the various types of American religion, and how diverse and, yes, strange they often are.  

## The Break

Though the book spends more than half of its length on pre-1960 America, Andersen believes that the 60s broke something loose in our national psyche, mainstreaming magical thinking in an unprecedented way —  what he calls “Full Fantasyland.” The 60s brought about a dangerous break with “consensus reality”; all the sudden _everyone_, not just the very religious, was encouraging people to “find their own truth.” This was not, of course, limited to religion, but became pervasive in popular culture and academia. 

For Andersen, nothing encapsulates the pernicious tendencies of this era than the Gestalt Prayer:

> I do my thing and you do your thing.
> I am not in this world to live up to your expectations,
> And you are not in this world to live up to mine.
> You are you, and I am I,
> and if by chance we find each other, it's beautiful. 
> If not, it can't be helped.

Of the prayer, Andersen writes, “in America, which _began_ on a slippery slope of subjectivity, this new creed helped accelerate the giant slalom towards a concoct-your-own-truth culture and society.” Indeed, the prayer does exemplify the thinking of the time, and its enshrining of subjectivity. Across previously fully “rational” institutions, in particular Universities, postmodernism began to chip away at shared notions of truth — e.g. “there are myriad perspectives on the world, each with its own legitimate claim to truth” 

What started in the 60s turned into a widespread cultural perspective, thoroughly mainstreamed by the mid-80s or so. By then, the “Establishment” had given “a big green light to treating beliefs as facts and the imaginary as actual.” There was now a “smog of subjectivity that… hung thick over the whole American mindscape” after the 60s and 70s. “The distinction between opinion and fact was crumbling on many fronts.” 

Andersen’s most trenchant point concerns the way in which what was done in the name of empowerment, self-actualization, or freedom from conformity became a powerful tool of reactionary forces. He persuasively shows how the lefty, self- affirming ideas of new-age spirituality and the academic questioning of reason opened the door for the nefarious insanity of today: “postmodern intellectuals… turned out to be useful idiots for the American right” That is, the Right was allowed to go off the rails —  with its extreme vision of Christianity, its new Theocratic ideas of American governance, its denial of science — because, along with more progressive ideologies, it was allowed to pursue its own truth, unbound to rational argument or any sense of shared reality. 

It’s a very good point that bears repeating: when the gates were opened, culturally, for the embrace of a multitude of perspectives, the guardrails of discourse were removed entirely, and shared truth was abandoned. What came through those gates was, at first, mildly progressive. But the gates remained opened for any and every kind of noxious idea and unhinged conspiracy to seep out and into the bloodstream of American culture.

## And yet…

These days it is tempting to agree wholeheartedly with Andersen, as we see how extreme, powerful, and pernicious magical thinking has become, in the person of Donald Trump, in climate change denialism, and in more extreme conspiracy thinkers like Alex Jones. And yet, I find myself unable to embrace his brand of rational bemusement at the various fantasies spun up by the particularly American ability to craft new realities. 

Andersen’s perspective is often rationalistic to a fault. He seems unable or unwilling to acknowledge the veracity or viability of every non-rational practice, from basically any religious observance to alternative medicines. His point is that these practices are not open to unbiased, rational verification and thus are boundlessly susceptible to overstatement, hyperbole, and blind adherence in the face of overwhelming evidence, but to abandon them entirely would leave a gaping void in human experience. 

In the end, isn’t there _something to_ all of the hokum? Perhaps plants aren’t sentient (as [“The Secret Life of Plants”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Life_of_Plants) would have us believe), but isn’t it clear that there is a life-force of which we are a part, that is intentionally suppressed by the ruling class and by the forces of capital that would rather us not look at the parts of our existence that are not quantifiable and controllable? How can we ever change the world if we cannot use our imagination to picture better realities? 

I wonder if there is some way to reconcile these perspectives, to embrace imagination and fantasy while remaining grounded in a rational belief in science and facts. I am a Catholic, a believer in things unseen and rationally impossible. And yet I have seen how many in the Church (sadly not a majority) have used their faith to adapt to science, to outside perspectives, other faiths, and to undeniable realities about our changing world. I believe in rationality, and I am dismayed by the state of the world and the extreme gullibility of a plurality of this country, but I don’t know if we would be better off without the spiritual pursuit of a better world, the belief that we can do better. Rationality and science are always changing and adapting to the world as well — witness the recent studies about the benefits of meditation or psychedelic drugs, which were once the exclusive domain of Fantasyland.

How do we embrace the positive aspects of spirituality, of alternative thinking, without descending into the fact-free zones inhabited by so many in our digital age?


## Final Thoughts

The cumulative effect of putting all of this in a single book is not to be underestimated. It is truly sobering to read about the range of absurd delusions that have been routinely touted by apparently “serious” Americans. It’s a long book, and it feels perhaps overly so, but to be fair, it does take a lot of pages to catalogue so much absurdity. And I don’t think it is at all controversial to see the breakdown of “consensus reality”, of any agreement on the facts or what is real, as the __fundamental__ reason that the great American tragedy of our time, the election of our 45th president, was even remotely possible.
