## Experimentation

This is a post, being edited in Emacs; I'm going to try some markdown now.

1. One
2. Thing
3. At 
4. A Time

And below is some Swift:

{% highlight swift %}
struct Teddy {
   var firstName = "Teddy"
   var level = 1

   mutating func levelUp() {
      level += 1
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}
