# The Skeptical Technologist

This is my personal site, which I am hereby naming The Skeptical Technologist. 

This is the best way I can describe myself at this moment in time.

This site will present my thoughts and writings on an array of topics. 

I plan to cross-post on dev.to and possibly Medium. 

Let the games begin.

### TODO

- add a button to edit the currently visible page on github (i.e. by forking and submitting a PR). Jekyll does this on their site and I think it's a great idea.
