# About this site

This site is an experiment, a living document.
I have called it the Skeptical Technologist. That phrase refers to me, Teddy J. Martin, but my sincere hope is that it is also many of you.

## A question

Ths internet has given us an incredible ability to connect with each other. Are we living up to the incredible potential of this network?

## What you (might) find here

Writing: thoughts, essays, experiments. Generally focused on technology and its social implications. Maybe some poetry.

Reading: what I'm reading, listening to, experiencing. 

Coding: programming projects, ideas, opinions on the art and practice of computer programming.

## How this (might) work
